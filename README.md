# Huffman Archiver

School project created during programming lessons in spring 2021.

## Description

This is implementation of the Huffman algorithm (static and dynamic) in Java.

Files `Archiver.java` and `Unarchiver.java` contain code for static algorithm.

Files `DymanicArchiver.java` and `DynamicUnarchiver.java` contain code for dynamic algorithm.

`HuffmannTree.java` contains function which builds Huffmann tree for the both types of archivers.

There are usage examples of each algorithm in `main` functions in corresponding files.
